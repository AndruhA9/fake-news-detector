# Fake News Detection Telegram Bot

@title_detector_bot

This is a **Fake News Detection Telegram Bot** that utilizes machine learning to classify news articles as either real or fake. Users can interact with the bot by sending news text or links, and the bot will analyze the content and provide a prediction based on a trained machine learning model. The bot uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and determine whether the provided information is likely to be fake or real.

## Features
- **Text-based News Detection**: Users can send text snippets of news articles, and the bot will predict whether the news is fake or real.
- **NLP for Text Preprocessing**: The bot cleans and preprocesses the input text, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lowercasing, before making predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The bot uses a trained classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) to classify news articles.
- **Real-time Responses**: The bot provides instant feedback via the Telegram interface, making it easy to verify the authenticity of news on the go.
- **Scalable Deployment**: The bot can be deployed locally or on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud for continuous availability.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The bot receives a message containing a news snippet or article text from the user.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is cleaned (punctuation removal, stopwords filtering, tokenization) using NLP techniques.
3. **Feature Extraction**: The preprocessed text is transformed into numerical features using methods like **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer**.
4. **Classification**: The bot applies a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) to predict whether the news is fake or real.
5. **Response**: The bot sends back the prediction to the user via the Telegram chat interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries:
  - `python-telegram-bot`
  - `TensorFlow`
  - `nltk`
  - `pandas`
  - `joblib`
  - `nltk` for text preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization)
- A Telegram bot token from **BotFather**

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection-telegram-bot.git
   cd fake-news-detection-telegram-bot
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Telegram Bot**
   - Create a new bot on Telegram using **BotFather** and get your bot token.
   - Add your Telegram bot token to the script.

4. **Train or Load the Machine Learning Model**
   - You can either use an existing trained model or train a new one using a dataset like the **Fake News Detection** dataset from Kaggle.
   - Save the trained model as a `.pkl` file.
   - Example to save a model:
     ```python
     from sklearn.externals import joblib
     joblib.dump(model, 'fake_news_model.pkl')
     ```

5. **Run the Bot**
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

6. **Interact with the Bot**
   - Open Telegram, search for your bot, and start sending news snippets to check if they are real or fake.

## Deployment (Optional)
To make your bot available 24/7, you can deploy it on cloud platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud**.

### Deploying on Heroku
1. **Create a Heroku App**
   ```bash
   heroku create
   ```

2. **Push the Code to Heroku**
   ```bash
   git push heroku master
   ```

3. **Set the Bot Token**
   ```bash
   heroku config:set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   ```

4. **Run the Bot**
   The bot will now be live on Heroku, and you can interact with it through Telegram.

## Datasets
You can use public datasets such as:
- [Fake News Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news)
- [LIAR Dataset](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip)
- [ISOT Fake News Dataset](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php)

## Future Improvements
- **Support for URLs**: Implement web scraping to analyze the text content of news articles from links.
- **Real-time News Monitoring**: Add the ability to monitor RSS feeds or real-time news APIs and flag potentially fake news.
- **More Advanced Models**: Experiment with deep learning models like LSTM or BERT to improve prediction accuracy.
